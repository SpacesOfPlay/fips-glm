fips-glm
========

Wraps around GLM and adds a fips.yml (see https://github.com/floooh/fips) so that GLM can be used as a dependency in a fips project.

This forks uses a more recent GLM version and disables GLM_FORCE_CTOR_INIT. The flag GLM_FORCE_RADIANS has been removed from GLM and is no longer needed.
